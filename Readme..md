We will create a Neural Networks based Factorization Machine: taking ideas from
https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/blob/master/chapter_recommender-systems/deepfm.md and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00091

Best performing model was the DeepFM as shown above with some slight changes in the MLP structure

On our ratings_small movielens dataset, it gave a final MSE on validation set of 0.81
